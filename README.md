## The Project
### Connections
#### Connection between the glove and the computer
This is a Bluetooth module. The bluetooth-transmitter (the glove) sends captured data continuously to the Bluetooth-receiver (a COM-port on the PC).

### Connection between the GUI and the running script
This connection gets made by using a network socket. The user has to establish a connection between the two parties in the GUI. One of the parties is the Application, the other party is the running script. A string of data with the specifications gets send to the running program.

### Handeling the data
When the data is received on the PC, it gets structured in variables. The continuous updates override the values of the variables each time there is an update. This process gets done by a thread called UpdateThread in the project. 

This values get passed on to other variables. These variables are validation variables. This is also a continuous process which is done by anther thread called UpdateThread in the project. It ensures that the validation variables are always up to date.

### Validating the data
The validation of the data is a continuous loop. The validation checks if the values of the variables are higher than certain border points. For example you are validating a finger. If the value of the finger reaches the border point, the finger bended.

When a validation is true, the corresponding macro gets called.

### Configuration of the GUI
The task of the GUI is to configure the glove's settings:
- In the GUI you can choose between an amount of predefined macroâ€™s.
- You can choose which macro you want to assign to each finger.
- Each finger can have 1 macro assigned to it.
When you have made a configuration, the configuration gets passed on to the program via a network socket (as beeing explained in the connections part).
